### Logstash-Forwarder Docker Image
[Logstash Forwarder](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-forwarder) [Docker Image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/million12/logstash-forwarder/) for logstash/elasticsearch logging deployments. 
Build from official logstash-forwarder repo and locked to release `v0.4.0`.  
Image was stripped down from not needed packages and from being ~650M now it's only ~335M 

### SSL Certificates and Log Files 
Logstash server ssl certificates need to be placed in `/etc/logstash/ssl/` directory. 

Default config is set to read `system.log` file from `/data/log/system.log`.  
Example of sharing system log with docker image.
  
`-v /var/log/system.log:/data/log/system.log`

### Logstash IP (Environmental Variable) 
`$LOGSTASH_IP` environmental variable with IP address to logstash server. 

### RUN
Run on the same host as logstash server

    docker run \
    -d --name forwarder \
    -e LOGSTASH_IP=logstash_server_ip \
    -v /var/log/system.log:/data/log/system.log \ 
    -v /etc/logstash/ssl:/logstash/ssl \
    million12/logstash-forwarder

FYI: Certificates should match logstash server certificates. 

### Logging
If you need to log more than just system.log please edit forwarder.conf file according the [logstash/forwarder manual](http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/).

Otherwise you can mount the directory with your host specific forwarder.conf using command `-v`.  
`-v /your-dir:/etc/forwarder/`
